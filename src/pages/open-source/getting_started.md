# Getting Started with Open Source

(Taken from one of my LinkedIn posts.)

I remember watching the React repository on GitHub for months and being absolutely intimidated.

I've come up with a rough framework and I have found it really effective with open source and onboarding myself to unfamiliar projects.

The whole idea is that it's like exercising. Do not expect to run a marathon on day one, that's not gonna happen. You need to work your way up to it.

1. Finding a repo to work on is a topic in of itself. I'll leave that for you to research, but get familiar with the GitHub issues page.

2. Make your first contribution as easy as possible. I specifically look for a GitHub Issue that I can fix with one or two lines of code.

When you land congratulations! Hopefully, that wasn't so bad.

3. Let's level up and tackle something a bit more difficult.

Rinse and repeat step 3.

The key is to make sure that you are growing sustainably.

If you push yourself too hard, you run the risk of hitting a brick wall and killing your momentum. The sweet spot for growth is outside your comfort zone, but not too far outside.

Before I volunteer to work on a issue, I like to check if I can get the project running first.

If the project takes 5 hours to setup, I might move on to a different project. It depends. I'll make a judgement call.

If all is good, I'll then volunteer to help out. Something along the lines of "hi, can I please work on this issue?" will do the trick.

Key information that will help:

- How to run the automated tests and the linter
- How to build the project
- Naming-conventions for branches and pull requests

When you get assigned to the issue, we can start working on the issue.

Generally this is the process:

- Fork repo
  -> create branch on your fork
  --> work in your branch
  ---> push your changes to your fork
  ----> create pull request

(But double check the docs for the specifics.)

❗Before pushing my work, I like to run the linting, testing and build processes. These will flag mistakes that I've left in my work.

Key areas that will help you (more relevant as you progress):

- Writing good commits
- Writing good pull requests (hint: make it easy to review)
- Git
